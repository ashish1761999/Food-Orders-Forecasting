üåü Empowering Business Decisions with Data Science: Food Order Forecasting üç¥

I'm excited to share my journey in a recent hackathon, where I tackled the challenges of forecasting food orders and revenue in the dynamic food industry. This project, enhanced with guidance from AI tools like ChatGPT, earned me a Certificate of Participation and deeper insights into real-world applications of data science.

üß© Project Overview
The goal was to analyze and forecast food order trends using a comprehensive dataset of 320,000+ records, uncovering key insights and building predictive models to optimize operations and customer satisfaction.

üîç Analysis & Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Uncovered trends in billing amounts across time and facilities.
Visualized billing by facility categories and city zip codes, identifying key revenue drivers.
Highlighted customer preferences via flavor profile distribution and course analysis.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Analysis:

Leveraged ANOVA and Chi-Square tests to quantify the impact of facility categories and promotions on billing.
Correlation analysis revealed strong predictors like orders_count, promotions, and labelled_price.
ü§ñ Predictive Modeling
Designed machine learning models to deliver actionable insights:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Prediction (Regression):

Achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1528.32 using a Linear Regression model to forecast billing amounts.
2Ô∏è‚É£ High vs. Low Billing Classification:

Classified orders into high and low billing categories with 95% accuracy using Logistic Regression. Key metrics:
Precision: 95%
Recall: 96%
Confusion Matrix Highlights:
True Positives: 53,741
True Negatives: 58,961
üìä Visualization Highlights
Created scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmaps to present key trends.
Showcased the correlation between promotions and revenue growth, enabling data-driven promotional strategies.
üåç Real-World Impact
This project highlights the power of data science in transforming business operations:

Smarter Promotions: Identified key factors driving customer engagement.
Optimized Inventory: Predicted demand trends to reduce waste and costs.
Personalized Offerings: Leveraged insights into flavor profiles for targeted marketing.
